<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sagnik Maity, a passionate and driven computer science student currently in my 5th semester, with a 
  strong academic record and a CGPA of 9.66. I am deeply interested in areas like algorithms, backend development, 
  and high-impact innovation. My journey in tech so far has been guided by a strong belief in the power of 
  consistent learning and practical problem-solving. I strive to go beyond textbooks, working on real-world 
  challenges, competitive coding, and development projects that push my limits and help me grow both technically 
  and personally.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic career, I’ve taken active steps to broaden my understanding by exploring subjects like 
  Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Mining, and Networks. I’ve also pursued hands-on learning 
  through projects, coding challenges, and development bootcamps, with the aim of becoming FAANG-ready within the 
  next two years. I believe in building things that create value — from system-level innovations to socially 
  impactful platforms — and I’m currently exploring ideas like decentralized reputation systems and language-first 
  operating systems tailored to India’s unique needs.</p>

<p>I see myself as someone who blends technical depth with a strong sense of purpose. Whether it's contributing 
  to open source, collaborating with peers, or leading ambitious projects, I enjoy being at the intersection of 
  code, creativity, and change. My goal is to not just excel in academics or land top-tier roles, but to one day 
  build world-changing tech that leaves a lasting legacy.</p>
